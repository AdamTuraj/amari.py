Special thanks to `Adam Turaj <https://github.com/AdamTuraj>`_ and `PhenoM4n4n <https://github.com/phenom4n4n>`_ for their outstanding work on the [`amari.py` wrapper](https://github.com/AdamTuraj/amari.py/tree/main). Without their original project, this fork, `amaripy`, would not have been possible!
