Getting an Authorization Token
==============================

To request an authorization token for the Amari API you are required to fill out `this <https://forms.gle/TEZ3YbbMPMEWYuuMA>`_ form. After about 24 hours you will get a DM from the `AmariBot <https://discord.com/users/339254240012664832/>`_. This DM will look like this :

Now head over to the `AmariBot website <https://amaribot.com>`_. At the top right you should either see Login or your profile picture. If it says login click on it to login.

Now hover over your profile picture seen in that corner, and click developer portal. There you should see all of the information you need including your token. This is what the portal looks like:
