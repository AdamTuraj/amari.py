Getting an Authorization Token
==============================

To request an authorization token for the Amari API you are required to fill out `this <https://forms.gle/TEZ3YbbMPMEWYuuMA>`_ form. After about 24 hours you will get a DM from the `AmariBot <https://discord.com/users/339254240012664832/>`_ telling you that you got access to your API token.
You can then head over to http://amaribot.com/developer/youruserid, login and then you will have access to your token!

Now head over to the `quickstart <https://amaripy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/quickstart.html>`_ section to get started!
